Around here, however, we dont look backwards for very long.We keep moving forward, opening up new doors & doing new things, because we're curious ... and curosity keeps leading us down new paths. - LESSON I LEARNT AFTER MEETING THE ROBINSONS :)

Life will have many setbacks.You will make mistakes. People close to you will hurt you.But you dont break it off with them.You dont hurt them more. You try to heal it. It's a lesson not only you, but our country needs to learn.
